# 👩‍💻 Hey there, I'm @Coderfaal!

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm a passionate (and sometimes struggling 😅) developer on a mission to master the art of **Java** and **Spring Boot** development.

## 👀 Interests
I’m a curious soul dabbling in everything from backend development to figuring out how the heck Kubernetes works. Right now, my main quest is building solid, real-world Spring Boot applications (bugs and all 🐞).

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Java (leveling up every day! ☕)
- Spring Boot (the magical framework)
- Writing better, cleaner code ✨
- How not to forget a semicolon 🙃

## 💞️ Looking to Collaborate On
- Java-based projects
- Spring Boot feature enhancements
- Beginner-friendly open-source repositories
- Projects where I can **learn by doing**

🧠 Open to connect, chat, or co-build something cool!

## 😄 Pronouns

## ⚡ Fun Fact
Despite calling myself *Coderfaal*, I refuse to give up — every failed build makes me stronger 💪🔥
